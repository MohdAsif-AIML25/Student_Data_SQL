# Student_Data_SQL
The Student Management System using SQL and Python is a mini project developed to manage student records efficiently using a database.
The project connects Python programming with an SQL database (SQLite) to perform basic database operations such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting student details.

The main objective of this project is to understand how Python interacts with databases and how SQL queries are executed through a Python application in real time.

📌 Understanding of the Project

Through this project, we understand that:

A database is used to store data permanently

Python acts as a bridge between the user and the database

SQL commands are executed using Python’s database library

User inputs are handled safely using parameterized queries

Database operations can be automated using a menu-driven program

The project simulates a real-world scenario where student data needs to be stored, updated, and managed efficiently.

📌 What We Learned from This Project

From this project, we learned the following concepts:

🔹 Technical Learning

How to connect Python with SQL (SQLite)

How to create tables using SQL

How to perform CRUD operations:

Create (INSERT)

Read (SELECT)

Update (UPDATE)

Delete (DELETE)

How to use sqlite3 module in Python

How to use functions and loops in Python

How to build a menu-driven program

🔹 Practical Learning

Importance of database management

How backend systems work

How real applications store and retrieve data

Writing clean and secure SQL queries

📌 Project Final Output
✅ Final Output Description

When the program is executed, it displays a menu-driven interface where the user can:

Add new student details

View all stored student records

Update an existing student’s information

Delete a student record

Exit the program

All operations are reflected directly in the database, ensuring data persistence.

✅ Sample Final Output (Console)
1. Add Student
2. View Students
3. Update Student
4. Delete Student
5. Exit

Enter choice: 1
Student added successfully

Enter choice: 2
(1, 'John', 20, 'Python', 'john@gmail.com')

Enter choice: 5
Program exited successfully

📌 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how Python and SQL can be integrated to create a simple database management system. It helps beginners understand database connectivity, SQL execution, and backend logic, making it a strong foundation for advanced projects like web applications and management systems.
